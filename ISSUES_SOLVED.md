⏺ Analysis of the Issue

  The issue you encountered was a Next.js build cache corruption problem.
  Here's what was happening:

  Root Cause

  The errors were related to missing temporary build manifest files in the
  .next directory:
  - _buildManifest.js.tmp.3cxsbz1iuqx
  - app-build-manifest.json
  - Various other temporary manifest files

  Why This Happens

  1. Interrupted Build Process: Next.js creates temporary files during the
  build process. If the process is interrupted (system crash, force quit,
  etc.), these temp files can be left in an inconsistent state
  2. File System Race Conditions: Multiple Next.js processes trying to
  access the same build files simultaneously
  3. Corrupted Cache: The .next cache directory became corrupted, causing
  Next.js to look for files that no longer exist or were never properly
  created

  What Was Done to Fix It

  1. Killed all Next.js processes to ensure no competing processes
  2. Removed the entire .next directory to clear all corrupted build cache
  3. Cleared node_modules/.cache to remove any cached dependencies
  4. Reinstalled dependencies with npm ci to ensure clean package state
  5. Restarted the development server with a fresh cache

  The project is using:
  - Next.js 15.1.3 with Turbopack (faster bundler)
  - React 19.0.0 (latest version)
  - Development server running on port 3000

// Actual solve Sept 8 14:36
 The server:

  1. ✅ Started successfully on port 3000
  2. ✅ Compiled the root page without errors
  3. ✅ Processed authentication checks
  4. ✅ No more missing middleware-manifest.json errors
  5. ✅ No more build manifest temp file errors

  Summary

  The original issues were caused by Next.js 15.1.3 build system problems:

  1. Turbopack incompatibility: The --turbopack flag caused build manifest
   file generation issues
  2. Missing middleware manifest: Development mode wasn't generating
  required server files properly

  What was fixed:

  - Removed --turbopack flag to use standard Webpack bundler
  - Created missing middleware-manifest.json file manually
  - Next.js 15.1.3 now works properly in development mode
